# Kerbal Space Program Mods Manager
A simple java mods manager application for Kerbal Space Program that works on Mac, Windows, and Linux.

This application removes the need to dig into hidden files/folders and apply mods manually. Instead,
you can import them directly, and enable/disable them quickly instead of having to remove them from 
the mods folder to uninstall
